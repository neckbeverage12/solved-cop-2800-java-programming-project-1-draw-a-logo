Download <a href="https://wpollock.com/lister.php?file=Java/GUIGreet.java&amp;nodir&amp;dl&amp;linenums">GUIGreet.java</a> to use as a starting point.  After installing the <abbr>JDK</abbr>, modify this program to display your own business card logo.  Your logo should contain some circles, lines, or rectangles, plus a business name (or just your name or a fake name) as text.  This must be a stand-alone program.

You are expected to use the Java <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> documentation (the “<abbr title="Java Developer Documentation">JavaDocs</abbr>”) for the <code>Graphics</code> class in the <code>java.awt</code> package, to find the “methods” you use to draw shapes and text.  (Hint:  Look for method names that start with “<code>draw</code>” or “<code>fill</code>”.)
